# TSS

A Ruby Gem implementation of the Threshold Secret Sharing, as specified in
the Network Working Group Internet-Draft submitted by D. McGrew
([draft-mcgrew-tss-03.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mcgrew-tss-03)).

Shares are returned in binary string form and support Robust Threshold Secret
Sharing (RTSS) as described in the Internet-Draft. RTSS hash types for
`NONE`, `SHA1`, and `SHA256` are supported.

## WARNING : PRE-ALPHA CODE

This code is currently a work in progress and is not yet ready for production
use. The API, input and output formats, and other aspects are likely to change
before release.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'tss'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tss

## Usage

### Splitting a Secret

The basic usage is as follows using the arguments described below.

```
shares = Splitter.new(secret, threshold, num_shares, identifier, hash_id).split
```

The `secret` (required) value must be provided as a String with either
the `UTF-8` or `US-ASCII` encoding with a Byte length  `<= 65,534`. You can
test this beforehand with `'my string secret'.bytes.to_a.length`

Internally, the `secret` String will be converted to and processed as an Array
of Bytes. e.g. `'foo'.bytes.to_a`

The `num_shares` (required) and `threshold` (required) values are Integers
representing the total number of shares desired, and how many of those shares
are required to re-create a `secret`. Both arguments must be Integers with a value
between `1-255` inclusive. The `num_shares` must be greater-than-or-equal-to the
`threshold` value specified.

The `identifier` (required) is a `0-16` Byte String that will be embedded in
each output share and should be unique. All shares output from the same
secret splitting operation will have the same `identifier`. This value
can be retrieved from any share and should be assumed to be known to shareholders
so nothing that leaks information about the secret should be used as an `identifier`.

The `hash_id` is an Integer code that represents which cryptographic One-Way Hash function
has been embedded in the shares to allow verification that the re-constructed
secret is a match for the original at creation time. There are currently three
valid values which have been specified as constants for your convenience.
`SecretHash::SHA256` is the recommended Hash Digest to use.

```
SecretHash::NONE                 // code 0
SecretHash::SHA1                 // code 1
SecretHash::SHA256               // code 2
```

Example:

```
secret = 'foo bar baz'
threshold = 3
num_shares = 5
identifier = SecureRandom.hex(8)
hash_id = SecretHash::SHA256

shares = Splitter.new(secret, threshold, num_shares, identifier, hash_id).split

=> ["ebe6ecfb44e31b12\x02\x03\x00,\x01\xB3\x81HJ\xF9\bNi\xE6\xBE\xC1b\xF8\xBFl\xBB>\xAB\x91O\xDAI\x8E\xD7\xB3\x13>m[K\xE1\x12p\x8E\x1D\x9E\x17_HM\x19\bw",

reconstructed_secret = Combiner.new(shares).combine
=> "foo bar baz"
```

### Combining Shares to Recreate a Secret

The basic usage is as follows using the arguments described below.

```
secret = Combiner.new(shares, args).combine
```

The `shares` is used when recreating the secret and must be provided as an Array
of encoded Share Byte Strings. You must provide at least as many shares as determined
by the `threshold` value set when the shares were originally created. If you
provide too few shares a `Tss::Error` exception will be raised.

The second argument expects a Hash to be provided where the default is:

```
{share_selection: :strict_first_x, output: :string_utf8}
```

#### Share Handling Args

```
share_selection: :strict_first_x
share_selection: :strict_sample_x
share_selection: :any_combination
```

`share_selection:` : This option determines how the Array of incoming shares
to be re-combined should be handled. One of the following options is valid:

`:strict_first_x` : If X shares are required by the threshold, then the
first X shares in the Array of shares provided will be used. All others will
be discarded and the operation will fail if those selected shares cannot
recreate the secret.

`:strict_sample_x` : If X shares are required, then X shares will be randomly
selected from the Array of shares provided.  All others will be discarded and
the operation will fail if those selected shares cannot recreate the secret.

`:any_combination` : If X shares are required, and more than X shares are
provided, then all possible combinations of the shares provided will be
tried to see if the secret can be recreated. This is a more flexible, but
possibly less-safe approach.

#### Secret Output Format Args

```
output: :string_utf8
output: :array_bytes
```

`output:` : The value for the hash key `output:` can be the Symbol `:string_utf8`
or `:array_bytes` which will return the recombined secret as either a UTF-8
String (default) or an Array of Bytes.

### Exception Handling

The splitting and combining operations may raise `Tss::ArgumentError`
or `Tss::Error` exceptions and you should rescue and handle them in your code.

`Tss::ArgumentError` exceptions will generally include the ActiveModel validation
hints where appropriate.

## Performance

The amount of time it takes to split or combine secrets grows significantly as
the size of the secret and the total `num_shares` increase. Splitting a secret
with the maximum size of `2**16 - 2` (65,534) Bytes and the maximum `255` shares
may take a long, long time to run. Splitting a secret with more reasonable values,
for example a `32 Byte` secret key with `16` total shares and a threshold of `8`
may only take milliseconds to run.

In either case it is likely prudent to run all operations asynchronously
in a background worker process or thread.

There are some simple benchmark tests you can run with `rake bench`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an
interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Thank You

This code is an implementation of the Threshold Secret Sharing, as specified in
the Network Working Group Internet-Draft submitted by D. McGrew
([draft-mcgrew-tss-03.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mcgrew-tss-03)).
This code would not have been possible without this very well designed and
documented specification. Many examples of the relevant text from the specification
has been used as comments to annotate this source code.

Great respect to SÃ©bastien Martini ([@seb-m](https://github.com/seb-m)) for
his [seb-m/tss](https://github.com/seb-m/tss) Python implementation of TSS.
It was invaluable as a real-world reference implementation of the TSS Internet-Draft
when coding this version of the TSS in Ruby.
