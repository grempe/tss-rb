  # As with every crypto algorithm, it is essential to test an
  # implementation of TSS or RTSS for correctness.  This section provides
  # guidance for such testing.
  #
  # The Secret Reconstruction algorithm can be tested using Known Answer
  # Tests (KATs).  Test cases are provided in Section 9.
  #
  # The Share Generation algorithm cannot be directly tested using a KAT.
  # It can be indirectly tested by generating secret values uniformly at
  # random, then applying the Share Generation process to them to
  # generate a set of shares, then applying the Share Reconstruction
  # algorithm to the shares, then finally comparing the reconstructed
  # secret to the original secret.  Implementations SHOULD perform this
  # test, using a variety of thresholds and secret lengths.
  #
  # The Share Index (the initial octet of each share) can never be equal
  # to zero.  This property SHOULD be tested.
  #
  # The random source must be tested to ensure that it has high min-
  # entropy.
  #
